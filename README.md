# Incentives for Creating Study Guides for Popular Topics

## Project Description

The **Incentives for Creating Study Guides for Popular Topics** project is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology to encourage the creation and sharing of high-quality study guides. It allows users to submit educational content, vote on guides, and earn ERC-20 tokens as rewards based on the quality and popularity of their submissions. The platform aims to foster a community-driven ecosystem where knowledge sharing is incentivized, transparent, and secure.

Using smart contracts on the Ethereum network, this project ensures that all submissions, votes, and rewards are recorded transparently on the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof record of content and interactions. The long-term goal is to make high-quality educational materials more accessible and reward creators for contributing to the learning community.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to create an open and decentralized platform for knowledge sharing, where individuals can contribute educational content and be fairly compensated for their efforts. By using blockchain technology, the project ensures that content creators are rewarded transparently and securely for their contributions. The goal is to build a sustainable, scalable educational ecosystem that empowers users to share and receive knowledge in a decentralized way.

### Long-Term Goals:
- **Encourage the creation of high-quality educational content**.
- **Empower content creators** by providing a transparent reward system.
- **Foster a decentralized learning community** that is driven by user contributions.
- **Build a sustainable and scalable platform** for knowledge sharing.

## Key Features

1. **Study Guide Submission**:  
   Users can submit their study guides related to popular academic or professional topics. These guides can include text-based content, links to PDFs, videos, or other external resources.

2. **Community Voting**:  
   Community members can vote on study guides, helping to determine the quality and relevance of the content. The more votes a guide receives, the higher the potential reward.

3. **ERC-20 Token-Based Rewards**:  
   Content creators are rewarded with ERC-20 tokens based on the number of votes and the quality of their guides. Tokens can be transferred, saved, or redeemed.

4. **Admin Approval**:  
   Admins have the ability to review submitted study guides and approve them for reward distribution. Admins ensure that the guides meet the required quality standards before tokens are allocated.

5. **Minting Rewards**:  
   Admins can mint additional tokens to ensure there are enough rewards for creators. This helps scale the reward pool as more content is added.

6. **Transparency & Security**:  
   All activities on the platform, including guide submissions, votes, and reward distributions, are recorded on the blockchain. This ensures complete transparency and security in the platform's operations.

7. **Scalable Ecosystem**:  
   The system is designed to support a wide variety of topics, subtopics, and educational content. As the platform grows, it can accommodate more diverse learning resources and creators.
